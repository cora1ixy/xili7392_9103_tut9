# IDEA9103 Week 9 Quiz

## Part 1
- I’m inspired by [the Swarmalators visualization by Dirk Brockmann] (https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/swarmalators/), which shows particles moving organically within a circular boundary. I’m particularly drawn to how the particles pulse, shift, and rotate randomly while maintaining an overall structure. This dynamic, playful motion feels like a perfect match for the circular motifs in Pacita Abad’s Wheels of Fortune (which would be our group’s chosen artwork to represent for the final project). I’d like to incorporate a similar sense of controlled chaos—circles drifting and interacting within bounds—to bring her vibrant, layered artwork to life. This technique supports our goal of animating the artwork.
